  Abstract                 = {In genetic association studies (GAS) as well as in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the mode of inheritance (dominant, additive and recessive) is usually not known a priori. Assuming an incorrect mode of inheritance may lead to substantial loss of power, whereas on the other hand, testing all possible models may result in an increased type I error rate. The situation is even more complicated in the meta-analysis of GAS or GWAS, in which individual studies are synthesized to derive an overall estimate. Meta-analysis increases the power to detect weak genotype effects, but heterogeneity and incompatibility between the included studies complicate things further. In this review, we present a comprehensive summary of the statistical methods used for robust analysis and genetic model selection in GAS and GWAS. We then discuss the application of such methods in the context of meta-analysis. We describe the theoretical properties of the various methods and the foundations on which they are based. We also present the available software implementations of the described methods. Finally, since only few of the available robust methods have been applied in the meta-analysis setting, we present some simple extensions that allow robust meta-analysis of GAS and GWAS. Possible extensions and proposals for future work are also discussed.}

There has been increasing interest in the power and size of the test and in determination of sample size, especially when there is potential misclassification in the 'exposure' category. This article provides a unified approach to determination of the power function over different sampling strategies (fixed overall sample size or fixed marginal sample sizes) and allowing for misclassification in one or both variables. The misclassification may be either differential or non-differential. In addition to the standard CA test, results are also given which provide some insight into the performance of the modified CA test, which utilizes a standard error obtained without invoking the null hypothesis. Even without misclassification, some new expressions are also obtained for determining power with a fixed overall sample size. Numerical illustrations are presented with an emphasis on the more commonly occurring problem of misclassification in the exposure category.}

  Abstract                 = {In case-control genetic association studies, the robust procedure, Pearson's Chi-square test, is commonly used for testing association between disease status and genetic markers. However, this test does not take the possible trend of relative risks, which are due to genotype, into account. On the contrary, although Cochran-Armitage trend test with optimal scores is more powerful; it is usually difficult to assign the correct scores in advance since the true genetic model is rarely known in practice. If the unknown underlying genetic models are misspecified, the trend test may lose power dramatically. Therefore, it is desirable to find a powerful yet robust statistical test for genome-wide association studies. In this paper, we propose a new test based on the partition of Pearson's Chi-square test statistic. The new test utilizes the information of the monotonic (increasing or decreasing) trend of relative risks and therefore in general is more powerful than the Chi-square test; furthermore, it reserves the robustness. Using simulated and real single nucleotide polymorphism data, we compare the performance of the proposed test with existing methods.}

  Abstract                 = {There is an emerging interest in sequencing-based association studies of multiple rare variants. Most association tests suggested in the literature involve collapsing rare variants with or without weighting. Recently, a variance-component score test [sequence kernel association test (SKAT)] was proposed to address the limitations of collapsing method. Although SKAT was shown to outperform most of the alternative tests, its applications and power might be restricted and influenced by missing genotypes. In this paper, we suggest a new method based on testing whether the fraction of causal variants in a region is zero. The new association test, T REM , is derived from a random-effects model and allows for missing genotypes, and the choice of weighting function is not required when common and rare variants are analyzed simultaneously. We performed simulations to study the type I error rates and power of four competing tests under various conditions on the sample size, genotype missing rate, variant frequency, effect directionality, and the number of non-causal rare variant and/or causal common variant. The simulation results showed that T REM was a valid test and less sensitive to the inclusion of non-causal rare variants and/or low effect common variants or to the presence of missing genotypes. When the effects were more consistent in the same direction, T REM also had better power performance. Finally, an application to the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study showed that rare causal variants at the FGFR2 gene were detected by T REM and SKAT, but T REM produced more consistent results for different sets of rare and common variants.}

In this paper, we propose a powerful and robust test without assuming any model restrictions. Our test is based on the selected 2 × 2 tables derived from the usual 2 × 3 table. By signals from these tables, we show through simulations across a wide range of allele frequencies and genetic models that this approach may produce a test which is almost uniformly most powerful in the analysis of low- and high-frequency variants.

Initial large scale studies focused on biomarker discovery for disease or disease progression and helped to understand biochemical pathways underlying disease. The first population-based studies that combined metabolomics and genome wide association studies (mGWAS) have increased our understanding of the (genetic) regulation of biochemical conversions. Measurements of metabolites as intermediate phenotypes are a potentially very powerful approach to uncover how genetic variation affects disease susceptibility and progression. However, we still face many hurdles in the interpretation of mGWAS data. Due to the composite nature of many metabolites, single enzymes may affect the levels of multiple metabolites and, conversely, levels of single metabolites may be affected by multiple enzymes. Here, we will provide a global review of the current status of mGWAS. We will specifically discuss the application of prior biological knowledge present in databases to the interpretation of mGWAS results and discuss the potential of mathematical models. As the technology continuously improves to detect metabolites and to measure genetic variation, it is clear that comprehensive systems biology based approaches are required to further our insight in the association between genes, metabolites and disease.

We also present two approaches FBAT-LC and FBAT-LCC based on linear combination of the univariate test statistics. Furthermore, all three approaches are shown to be unified to a general form. Through simulation studies, we compare the power of these tests under different models of genetic effect sizes. Compared to original FBAT-PC, our modification achieves a power gain of up to 50\%. In addition, all three new approaches gain substantial power compared to the ordinary approach of Bonferroni correction, with the relative performance depending upon the underlying model. Application of these approaches for testing an association between Body Mass Index and a previously reported candidate SNP confirms our results.}

An isoform encoded by SYNE1 has been reported to be downregulated in ovarian and other cancers. rs2295190 was genotyped in an additional 12 studies through the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium, with 5,279 invasive epithelial cases and 7,450 controls.

No association was observed for the endometrioid subtype. In an additional analysis of 1,459 borderline ovarian cancer cases and 7,370 controls, rs2295190 was not associated with risk. These data provide suggestive evidence that the rs2295190 T allele, or another allele in linkage disequilibrium with it, may be associated with increased risk of invasive ovarian cancer.}

  Abstract                 = {Recently more and more evidence suggest that rare variants with much lower minor allele frequencies play significant roles in disease etiology. Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies will lead to many more rare variants association studies. Several statistical methods have been proposed to assess the effect of rare variants by aggregating information from multiple loci across a genetic region and testing the association between the phenotype and aggregated genotype. One limitation of existing methods is that they only look into the marginal effects of rare variants but do not systematically take into account effects due to interactions among rare variants and between rare variants and environmental factors. In this article, we propose the summation of partition approach (SPA), a robust model-free method that is designed specifically for detecting both marginal effects and effects due to gene-gene (G×G) and gene-environmental (G×E) interactions for rare variants association studies. SPA has three advantages. First, it accounts for the interaction information and gains considerable power in the presence of unknown and complicated G×G or G×E interactions. Secondly, it does not sacrifice the marginal detection power; in the situation when rare variants only have marginal effects it is comparable with the most competitive method in current literature. Thirdly, it is easy to extend and can incorporate more complex interactions; other practitioners and scientists can tailor the procedure to fit their own study friendly. Our simulation studies show that SPA is considerably more powerful than many existing methods in the presence of G×G and G×E interactions.}

Corresponding to each underlying genetic model there is a particular set of scores assigned to the genotypes that maximizes its power. When the variance of the test statistic is known, the formulas for approximate power and associated sample size are readily obtained. In practice, however, the variance of the test statistic needs to be estimated. We present formulas for the required sample size to achieve a prespecified power that account for the need to estimate the variance of the test statistic. When the underlying genetic model is unknown one can incur a substantial loss of power when a test suitable for one mode of inheritance is used where another mode is the true one. Thus, tests having good power properties relative to the optimal tests for each model are useful. These tests are called efficiency robust and we study two of them: the maximin efficiency robust test is a linear combination of the standardized optimal tests that has high efficiency and the MAX test, the maximum of the standardized optimal tests. Simulation results of the robustness of these two tests indicate that the more computationally involved MAX test is preferable.}

In this study we directly compared a number of multivariate GWAS methods using simulated data. We focused on six methods that are implemented in the software packages PLINK, SNPTEST, MultiPhen, BIMBAM, PCHAT and TATES, and also compared them to standard univariate GWAS, analysis of the first principal component of the traits, and meta-analysis of univariate results. We simulated data (N = 1000) for three quantitative traits and one bi-allelic quantitative trait locus (QTL), and varied the number of traits associated with the QTL (explained variance 0.1\%), minor allele frequency of the QTL, residual correlation between the traits, and the sign of the correlation induced by the QTL relative to the residual correlation. We compared the power of the methods using empirically fixed significance thresholds ($\alpha$ = 0.05). Our results showed that the multivariate methods implemented in PLINK, SNPTEST, MultiPhen and BIMBAM performed best for the majority of the tested scenarios, with a notable increase in power for scenarios with an opposite sign of genetic and residual correlation. All multivariate analyses resulted in a higher power than univariate analyses, even when only one of the traits was associated with the QTL. Hence, use of multivariate GWAS methods can be recommended, even when genetic correlations between traits are weak.}

  Abstract                 = {Many statistical tests have been proposed for case-control data to detect disease association with multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in linkage disequilibrium. The main reason for the existence of so many tests is that each test aims to detect one or two aspects of many possible distributional differences between cases and controls, largely due to the lack of a general and yet simple model for discrete genotype data. Here we propose a latent variable model to represent SNP data: the observed SNP data are assumed to be obtained by discretizing a latent multivariate Gaussian variate. Because the latent variate is multivariate Gaussian, its distribution is completely characterized by its mean vector and covariance matrix, in contrast to much more complex forms of a general distribution for discrete multivariate SNP data. We propose a composite likelihood approach for parameter estimation. A direct application of this latent variable model is to association testing with multiple SNPs in a candidate gene or region. In contrast to many existing tests that aim to detect only one or two aspects of many possible distributional differences of discrete SNP data, we can exclusively focus on testing the mean and covariance parameters of the latent Gaussian distributions for cases and controls. Our simulation results demonstrate potential power gains of the proposed approach over some existing methods.}

  Abstract                 = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous associations between genetic loci and individual phenotypes; however, relatively few GWAS have attempted to detect pleiotropic associations, in which loci are simultaneously associated with multiple distinct phenotypes. We show that pleiotropic associations can be directly modeled via the construction of simple Bayesian networks, and that these models can be applied to produce single or ensembles of Bayesian classifiers that leverage pleiotropy to improve genetic risk prediction. The proposed method includes two phases: (1) Bayesian model comparison, to identify Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with one or more traits; and (2) cross-validation feature selection, in which a final set of SNPs is selected to optimize prediction. To demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of the method, a total of 1600 case-control GWAS datasets with two dichotomous phenotypes were simulated under 16 scenarios, varying the association strengths of causal SNPs, the size of the discovery sets, the balance between cases and controls, and the number of pleiotropic causal SNPs. Across the 16 scenarios, prediction accuracy varied from 90 to 50\%. In the 14 scenarios that included pleiotropically associated SNPs, the pleiotropic model search and prediction methods consistently outperformed the naive model search and prediction. In the two scenarios in which there were no true pleiotropic SNPs, the differences between the pleiotropic and naive model searches were minimal. To further evaluate the method on real data, a discovery set of 1071 sickle cell disease (SCD) patients was used to search for pleiotropic associations between cerebral vascular accidents and fetal hemoglobin level. Classification was performed on a smaller validation set of 352 SCD patients, and showed that the inclusion of pleiotropic SNPs may slightly improve prediction, although the difference was not statistically significant. The proposed method is robust, computationally efficient, and provides a powerful new approach for detecting and modeling pleiotropic disease loci.}

In addition, PleioGRiP implements an extension to the Bayesian search and classification and can search for pleiotropic relationships in which SNPs are simultaneously associated with two or more distinct phenotypes. These relationships can be used to generate connected Bayesian classifiers to predict the phenotype of interest either using genetic data alone or in combination with the secondary phenotype(s).

It is robust in case of deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, has excellent and reasonable power under additive and to a certain extent domi- nant modes of inheritance, respectively. Its power is low for recessive genetic models. Alternatively , Pearson’s chi square test is sensitive against any heterogeneity. The MAX-test has received increasing interest recently because it is sensitive against additive, dominant, and recessive modes of inheritance. The MAX-test requires calculation of p-values through permutation procedures. Recently, a resampling ap- proach including both Pearson-type heterogeneity and MAX-type tests to provide a test which is both sensitive to the three basic modes and further heterogeneity We formulate the Pearson-type heterogeneity test as a maximum test for linear differ- ences to the grand mean and do not use the standard quadratic form of Pearson’s chi square test. This enables us to combine the heterogeneity test and model-specific alternatives by use of linear contrasts in the framework of analysis of variance and to provide the asymptotic distribution of different versions of the MAX-test. The approach is extended to the generalized linear model , thus allows for dichotomous or quantitative traits and the adjustment for covariates. We provide an approach for confidence interval estimation which keeps the nominal confidence level in the MAX-test setting. Particularly, we provide closed expressions for power calculation. The approach is validated by simulations and illustrated by re-analyzing real data candidate gene data and a genome-wide association study. The use of related R software is illustrated in the paper. — Alter abstract war: The question arises what is the optimal test for the evaluation of a single marker in genome-wide association studies. For case-control designs the Cochran-Armitage trend test is widely used. Although this test is particularly sensitive for the additive mode of inheritance, ar- guments for its model-robustness exist. Alternatively a Pearson global test or the MAX-3 test can be used. The first is sensitive against any heterogeneity, the second against the additive or dominant or recessive mode. Resampling approaches exist including both heterogeneity and MAX-type tests. Here, the heterogeneity test is formulated as a maximum test for linear differences to grand mean, instead of the quadratic form of Pearson test. This allows an easy combination of heterogeneity and model-specific alternatives. A closed expression for both central and non-central distribution is provided within the generalized linear model.

Depending on the underlying genetic mode of inheritance, the use of model-specific scores maximises the power. Commonly, the underlying genetic model, i.e. additive, dominant or recessive mode of inheritance, is a priori unknown. Association studies are commonly analysed using permutation tests, where both inference and identification of the underlying mode of inheritance are important. Especially interesting are tests for case-control studies, defined by a maximum over a series of standardised CA tests, because such a procedure has power under all three genetic models. We reformulate the test problem and propose a conditional maximum test of scores-specific linear-by-linear association tests. For maximum-type, sum and quadratic test statistics the asymptotic expectation and covariance can be derived in a closed form and the limiting distribution is known. Both the limiting distribution and approximations of the exact conditional distribution can easily be computed using standard software packages. In addition to these technical advances, we extend the area of application to stratified designs, studies involving more than two groups and the simultaneous analysis of multiple loci by means of multiplicity-adjusted p-values for the underlying multiple CA trend tests. The new test is applied to reanalyse a study investigating genetic components of different subtypes of psoriasis. A new and flexible inference tool for association studies is available both theoretically as well as practically since already available software packages can be easily used to implement the suggested test procedures.}

To analyze such data, various multivariate tests have been proposed to investigate the association between the underlying disease genes and the multiple traits. Although these multivariate association tests may have better power performance than the univariate association tests, they suffer from loss of testing power when the genetic models of the putative genes are misspecified. To address the problem, in this paper we aim to develop a family-based robust multivariate association test. We will first establish the optimal multivariate score tests for the recessive, additive, and dominant genetic models. Based on these optimal tests, a maximum-type robust multivariate association test is then obtained. Simulations are conducted to compare the power of our method with that of other existing multivariate methods. The results show that the robust multivariate test does manifest the robustness in power over all plausible genetic models. A practical data set is applied to demonstrate the applicability of our approach. The results suggest that the robust multivariate test is more powerful than the robust univariate test when dealing with multiple quantitative traits.}

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: The concept of pleiotropy was proposed a century ago, though up to now there have been insufficient efforts to design robust statistics and software aimed at visualizing and evaluating pleiotropy at a regional level. The Pleiotropic Region Identification Method (PRIMe) was developed to evaluate potentially pleiotropic loci based upon data from multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS). METHODS: We first provide a software tool to systematically identify and characterize genomic regions where low association P-values are observed with multiple traits. We use the term Pleiotropy Index to denote the number of traits with low association P-values at a particular genomic region. For GWAS assumed to be uncorrelated, we adopted the binomial distribution to approximate the statistical significance of the Pleiotropy Index. For GWAS conducted on traits with known correlation coefficients, simulations are performed to derive the statistical distribution of the Pleiotropy Index under the null hypothesis of no genotype-phenotype association. For six hematologic and three blood pressure traits where full GWAS results were available from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium, we estimated the trait correlations and applied the simulation approach to examine genomic regions with statistical evidence of pleiotropy. We then applied the approximation approach to explore GWAS summarized in the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) GWAS Catalog. RESULTS: By simulation, we identified pleiotropic regions including SH2B3 and BRAP (12q24.12) for hematologic and blood pressure traits. By approximation, we confirmed the genome-wide significant pleiotropy of these two regions based on the GWAS Catalog data, together with an exploration on other regions which highlights the FTO, GCKR and ABO regions.

We identified four SNPs in intron 2 of FGFR2 (which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase and is amplified or overexpressed in some breast cancers) that were highly associated with breast cancer and confirmed this association in 1,776 affected individuals and 2,072 controls from three additional studies. Across the four studies, the association with all four SNPs was highly statistically significant (P(trend) for the most strongly associated SNP (rs1219648) = 1.1 x 10(-10); population attributable risk = 16\%). Four SNPs at other loci most strongly associated with breast cancer in the initial GWAS were not associated in the replication studies. Our summary results from the GWAS are available online in a form that should speed the identification of additional risk loci.}

  Abstract                 = {The recent development of high-throughput sequencing technologies calls for powerful statistical tests to detect rare genetic variants associated with complex human traits. Sampling related individuals in sequencing studies offers advantages over sampling unrelated individuals only, including improved protection against sequencing error, the ability to use imputation to make more efficient use of sequence data, and the possibility of power boost due to more observed copies of extremely rare alleles among relatives. With related individuals, familial correlation needs to be accounted for to ensure correct control over type I error and to improve power. Recognizing the limitations of existing rare-variant association tests for family data, we propose MONSTER (Minimum P-value Optimized Nuisance parameter Score Test Extended to Relatives), a robust rare-variant association test, which generalizes the SKAT-O method for independent samples. MONSTER uses a mixed effects model that accounts for covariates and additive polygenic effects. To obtain a powerful test, MONSTER adaptively adjusts to the unknown configuration of effects of rare-variant sites. MONSTER also offers an analytical way of assessing P-values, which is desirable because permutation is not straightforward to conduct in related samples. In simulation studies, we demonstrate that MONSTER effectively accounts for family structure, is computationally efficient and compares very favorably, in terms of power, to previously proposed tests that allow related individuals. We apply MONSTER to an analysis of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the Framingham Heart Study, where we are able to replicate association with three genes.}

METHODS: The entropy-based metric k-way interaction information (KWII) was critically assessed for utility in detecting interactions with count data and over-dispersed count data in three simulation studies of increasing complexity and in datasets from animal models of depression and colitis. The results were compared to Poisson regression. The power and effect size dependence of the KWII for detecting interactions was also assessed. RESULTS: The KWII was capable of effectively identifying the genetic and environmental predictors and their interactions in all three simulated datasets. The results indicate that the KWII approach may produce more parsimonious results than regression. In a rat model of depression, we successfully identified a prominent gender effect as well as other published associations. Analysis of severity scores from an animal model of colitis identified markers from chromosome 3, as well as unique first- and second-order associations for the individual sections of the colon and cecum. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the utility and versatility of our entropy-based method for gene-environment interaction analysis of count and rate data with Poisson and over-dispersed distributions.}

While linear regression models assume an additive mode of inheritance via equi-distant genotype scores, Kruskal-Wallis test merely tests global differences in trait values associated with the three genotype groups. Both approaches thus exhibit suboptimal power when the underlying inheritance mode is dominant or recessive. Furthermore, these tests do not perform well in the common situations when only a few trait values are available in a rare genotype category (disbalance), or when the values associated with the three genotype categories exhibit unequal variance (variance heterogeneity). We propose a maximum test based on Marcus-type multiple contrast test for relative effect sizes. This test allows model-specific testing of either dominant, additive or recessive mode of inheritance, and it is robust against variance heterogeneity. We show how to obtain mode-specific simultaneous confidence intervals for the relative effect sizes to aid in interpreting the biological relevance of the results. Further, we discuss the use of a related all-pairwise comparisons contrast test with range preserving confidence intervals as an alternative to Kruskal-Wallis heterogeneity test. We applied the proposed maximum test to the Bogalusa Heart Study dataset, and gained a remarkable increase in the power to detect association, particularly for rare genotypes. Our simulation study also demonstrated that the proposed non-parametric tests control family-wise error rate in the presence of non-normality and variance heterogeneity contrary to the standard parametric approaches. We provide a publicly available R library nparcomp that can be used to estimate simultaneous confidence intervals or compatible multiplicity-adjusted p-values associated with the proposed maximum test.}

We study seven robust test statistics for such association when the underlying genetic model is unknown, for data on disease status (case or control) and genotype (three genotypes of a biallelic genetic marker). In such studies, p-values have predominantly been calculated by asymptotic approximations or by simulated permutations. We consider an exact method, conditional enumeration. When the number of simulated permutations tends to infinity, the permutation p-value approaches the conditional enumeration p-value, but calculating the latter is much more efficient than performing simulated permutations. We have studied case-control sample sizes with 500-5000 cases and 500-15,000 controls, and significance levels from 5×10-8 to 0.05, thus our results are applicable to genetic association studies with only a few genetic markers under study, intermediate follow-up studies, and genome-wide association studies. Our main findings are: (i) If all monotone genetic models are of interest, the best performance in the situations under study is achieved for the robust test statistics based on the maximum over a range of Cochran-Armitage trend tests with different scores and for the constrained likelihood ratio test. (ii) For significance levels below 0.05, for the test statistics under study, asymptotic approximations may give a test size up to 20 times the nominal level, and should therefore be used with caution. (iii) Calculating p-values based on exact conditional enumeration is a powerful, valid and computationally feasible approach, and we advocate its use in genetic association studies.}

Traditionally, genetic correlations between complex traits are estimated from pedigree studies, but such estimates can be confounded by shared environmental factors. Moreover, for diseases, low prevalence rates imply that even if the true genetic correlation between disorders was high, co-aggregation of disorders in families might not occur or could not be distinguished from chance. We have developed and implemented statistical methods based on linear mixed models to obtain unbiased estimates of the genetic correlation between pairs of quantitative traits or pairs of binary traits of complex diseases using population-based case-control studies with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data. The method is validated in a simulation study and applied to estimate genetic correlation between various diseases from Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium data in a series of bivariate analyses. We estimate a significant positive genetic correlation between risk of Type 2 diabetes and hypertension of \~{}0.31 (SE 0.14, P = 0.024).

  Abstract                 = {An important task of human genetics studies is to predict accurately disease risks in individuals based on genetic markers, which allows for identifying individuals at high disease risks, and facilitating their disease treatment and prevention. Although hundreds of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted on many complex human traits in recent years, there has been only limited success in translating these GWAS data into clinically useful risk prediction models. The predictive capability of GWAS data is largely bottlenecked by the available training sample size due to the presence of numerous variants carrying only small to modest effects. Recent studies have shown that different human traits may share common genetic bases. Therefore, an attractive strategy to increase the training sample size and hence improve the prediction accuracy is to integrate data from genetically correlated phenotypes. Yet, the utility of genetic correlation in risk prediction has not been explored in the literature. In this paper, we analyzed GWAS data for bipolar and related disorders and schizophrenia with a bivariate ridge regression method, and found that jointly predicting the two phenotypes could substantially increase prediction accuracy as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We also found similar prediction accuracy improvements when we jointly analyzed GWAS data for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The empirical observations were substantiated through our comprehensive simulation studies, suggesting that a gain in prediction accuracy can be obtained by combining phenotypes with relatively high genetic correlations. Through both real data and simulation studies, we demonstrated pleiotropy can be leveraged as a valuable asset that opens up a new opportunity to improve genetic risk prediction in the future.}

In this article, we propose statistical methods for detecting associations between a censored quantitative trait and candidate genes in structured populations with complex multiple levels of genetic relatedness among sampled individuals. The proposed methods correct for continuous population stratification using both population structure variables as covariates and the frailty terms attributable to kinship. The relationship between the time-at-onset data and genotypic scores at a candidate marker is modeled via a parametric Weibull frailty accelerated failure time (AFT) model as well as a semiparametric frailty AFT model, where the baseline survival function is flexibly modeled as a mixture of Polya trees centered around a family of Weibull distributions. For both parametric and semiparametric models, the frailties are modeled via an intrinsic Gaussian conditional autoregressive prior distribution with the kinship matrix being the adjacency matrix connecting subjects. Simulation studies and applications to the Arabidopsis thaliana line flowering time data sets demonstrated the advantage of the new proposals over existing approaches.}

A common practice in studying gene-environment (GE) interactions is to analyze one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at a time. It is of significant interest to analyze SNPs in a biologically defined set simultaneously, e.g. gene or pathway. In this paper, we first show that if the main effects of multiple SNPs in a set are associated with a disease/trait, the classical single SNP-GE interaction analysis can be biased. We derive the asymptotic bias and study the conditions under which the classical single SNP-GE interaction analysis is unbiased. We further show that, the simple minimum p-value-based SNP-set GE analysis, can be biased and have an inflated Type 1 error rate. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a computationally efficient and powerful gene-environment set association test (GESAT) in generalized linear models. Our method tests for SNP-set by environment interactions using a variance component test, and estimates the main SNP effects under the null hypothesis using ridge regression. We evaluate the performance of GESAT using simulation studies, and apply GESAT to data from the Harvard lung cancer genetic study to investigate GE interactions between the SNPs in the 15q24-25.1 region and smoking on lung cancer risk.}

The standard approach is the Cochran-Armitage trend test or its logistic regression equivalent although this approach can lose considerable power if the underlying genetic model is not additive. An alternative is the MAX test, which is robust against the three basic modes of inheritance. Here, the asymptotic distribution of the MAX test is derived using the generalized linear model together with the Delta method and multiple contrasts. The approach is applicable to binary, quantitative, and survival traits. It may be used for unrelated individuals, family-based studies, and matched pairs. The approach provides point and interval effect estimates and allows selecting the most plausible genetic model using the minimum P-value. R code is provided. A Monte-Carlo simulation study shows that the asymptotic MAX test framework meets type I error levels well, has good power, and good model selection properties for minor allele frequencies ?0.3. Pearson's $\chi$(2)-test is superior for lower minor allele frequencies with low frequencies for the rare homozygous genotype. In these cases, the model selection procedure should be used with caution. The use of the MAX test is illustrated by reanalyzing findings from seven genome-wide association studies including case-control, matched pairs, and quantitative trait data.}

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge of genes influencing longitudinal patterns may offer information about predicting disease progression. We developed a systematic procedure for testing association between SNP genotypes and longitudinal phenotypes. We evaluated false positive rates and statistical power to localize genes for disease progression. We used genome-wide SNP data from the Framingham Heart Study. With longitudinal data from two real studies unrelated to Framingham, we estimated three trajectory curves from each study. We performed simulations by randomly selecting 500 individuals. In each simulation replicate, we assigned each individual to one of the three trajectory groups based on the underlying hypothesis (null or alternative), and generated corresponding longitudinal data. Individual Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPPs) for belonging to a specific trajectory curve were estimated. These BPPs were treated as a quantitative trait and tested (using the Wald test) for genome-wide association. Empirical false positive rates and power were calculated. Our method maintained the expected false positive rate for all simulation models. Also, our method achieved high empirical power for most simulations. Our work presents a method for disease progression gene mapping. This method is potentially clinically significant as it may allow doctors to predict disease progression based on genotype and determine treatment accordingly.}

  Abstract                 = {In genome-wide association studies of binary traits, investigators typically use logistic regression to test common variants for disease association within studies, and combine association results across studies using meta-analysis. For common variants, logistic regression tests are well calibrated, and meta-analysis of study-specific association results is only slightly less powerful than joint analysis of the combined individual-level data. In recent sequencing and dense chip based association studies, investigators increasingly test low-frequency variants for disease association. In this paper, we seek to (1) identify the association test with maximal power among tests with well controlled type I error rate and (2) compare the relative power of joint and meta-analysis tests. We use analytic calculation and simulation to compare the empirical type I error rate and power of four logistic regression based tests: Wald, score, likelihood ratio, and Firth bias-corrected. We demonstrate for low-count variants (roughly minor allele count [MAC] < 400) that: (1) for joint analysis, the Firth test has the best combination of type I error and power; (2) for meta-analysis of balanced studies (equal numbers of cases and controls), the score test is best, but is less powerful than Firth test based joint analysis; and (3) for meta-analysis of sufficiently unbalanced studies, all four tests can be anti-conservative, particularly the score test. We also establish MAC as the key parameter determining test calibration for joint and meta-analysis.}

Next, we propose a Cox-Snell residual-based score test, which allows us to handle the controlling variables more conveniently. We also illustrated the incorporation of these three tests into a permutation procedure to adjust for the multiple testing. In addition, we examine a simulation-based approach proposed by Lin (2005) to adjust for multiple testing. We presented the comparison of these four statistics in terms of type I error, power, family-wise error rate, and computational efficiency under various scenarios via extensive simulation.}

  Abstract                 = {The genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach has discovered hundreds of genetic variants associated with diseases and quantitative traits. However, despite clinical overlap and statistical correlation between many phenotypes, GWAS are generally performed one-phenotype-at-a-time. Here we compare the performance of modelling multiple phenotypes jointly with that of the standard univariate approach. We introduce a new method and software, MultiPhen, that models multiple phenotypes simultaneously in a fast and interpretable way. By performing ordinal regression, MultiPhen tests the linear combination of phenotypes most associated with the genotypes at each SNP, and thus potentially captures effects hidden to single phenotype GWAS. We demonstrate via simulation that this approach provides a dramatic increase in power in many scenarios. There is a boost in power for variants that affect multiple phenotypes and for those that affect only one phenotype. While other multivariate methods have similar power gains, we describe several benefits of MultiPhen over these. In particular, we demonstrate that other multivariate methods that assume the genotypes are normally distributed, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and MANOVA, can have highly inflated type-1 error rates when testing case-control or non-normal continuous phenotypes, while MultiPhen produces no such inflation. To test the performance of MultiPhen on real data we applied it to lipid traits in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966). In these data MultiPhen discovers 21\% more independent SNPs with known associations than the standard univariate GWAS approach, while applying MultiPhen in addition to the standard approach provides 37\% increased discovery. The most associated linear combinations of the lipids estimated by MultiPhen at the leading SNPs accurately reflect the Friedewald Formula, suggesting that MultiPhen could be used to refine the definition of existing phenotypes or uncover novel heritable phenotypes.}

However, the true underlying genetic model is often unknown, and using an incorrect model may cause serious loss of power. For case-control studies, it is known that the combination of several tests that are optimal for different models is robust to model misspecification. In this paper, we extend the test combination approach to quantitative trait association. We first derive the exact correlations among transformed test statistics and discuss interesting special cases. We then propose and evaluate a multivariate normality based approximation to the joint distribution of test statistics, such that the marginal distributions and pairwise correlations among test statistics are accounted for. Through simulations, we show that the sizes of the resulting approximate combined tests are accurate for practical purposes under a variety of situations. We find that the combination of the tests from the additive model and the genotypic model performs well, because it demonstrates both robustness to incorrect models and satisfactory power. A mouse lipoprotein data set is used to demonstrate the method.}

Here, we investigated the relationship between polymorphisms in the genes encoding for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (G-238A, G-308A), interleukin-1beta (C-511T, T+3953C), and interleukin-1Ra (intron 2), and cytokine production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors, and analyzed the distribution of these polymorphisms in patients with psoriasis vulgaris (n = 231) and healthy controls (n = 345). Carriage of tumor necrosis factor A-238 allele 2 (-238*A) was associated with increased production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in response to lipopolysaccharide in vitro, and with early onset disease (< 40 y), especially in male patients with psoriasis [32\% vs 7\% in male controls; odds ratio = 6.78, 95\% confidence interval = (3.18-15.15), p(adjusted) = 2 x 10(-7)].

These findings indicate that gene polymorphisms associated with altered cytokine responses in vitro may modify age of onset of psoriasis. They also provide further evidence that patients with early and late onset psoriasis differ in their genetic background.}

However, an integrated analysis of multiple phenotypes can provide insight into their shared genetic basis and may improve the power of association studies. We present a new method, called "phenotype set enrichment analysis" (PSEA), which uses ideas of gene set enrichment analysis for the investigation of phenotype sets. PSEA combines statistics of univariate phenotype analyses and tests by permutation. It does not only allow analyzing predefined phenotype sets, but also to identify new phenotype sets. Apart from the application to situations where phenotypes and genotypes are available for each person, the method was adjusted to the analysis of GWAS summary statistics. PSEA was applied to data from the population-based cohort KORA F4 (N = 1,814) using iron-related and blood count traits. By confirming associations previously found in large meta-analyses on these traits, PSEA was shown to be a reliable tool. Many of these associations were not detectable by GWAS on single phenotypes in KORA F4. Therefore, the results suggest that PSEA can be more powerful than a single phenotype GWAS for the identification of association with multiple phenotypes. PSEA is a valuable method for analysis of multiple phenotypes, which can help to understand phenotype networks. Its flexible design enables both the use of prior knowledge and the generation of new knowledge on connection of multiple phenotypes. A software program for PSEA based on GWAS results is available upon request.}

The costs and organizational sophistication necessary to collect repeated measurements or longitudinal data for a given phenotype are clearly impediments to this, but greater efforts in this area are needed if insights into human phenotypic expression are to be obtained. Appropriate data analysis methods for genetic association studies involving repeated or longitudinal measures are also needed. We consider the use of longitudinal profiles obtained from fitted functions on repeated data collections from a set of individuals whose similarities are contrasted between sets of individuals with different genotypes to test hypotheses about genetic influences on time-dependent phenotype expression. The proposed approach can accommodate uncertainty of the fitted functions, as well as weighting factors across the time points, and is easily extended to a wide variety of complex analysis settings. We showcase the proposed approach with data from a clinical study investigating human blood vessel response to tyramine. We also compare the proposed approach with standard analytic procedures and investigate its robustness and power via simulation studies. The proposed approach is found to be quite flexible and performs either as well or better than traditional statistical methods.}

SNP pleiotropic status was associated with gene location (p = 0.024; pleiotropic SNPs more often exonic [14.5\% versus 4.9\% for nonpleiotropic, trait-associated SNPs] and less often intergenic [15.8\% versus 23.6\%]), "predicted transcript consequence" (p = 0.001; pleiotropic SNPs more often predicted to be structurally deleterious [5\% versus 0.4\%] but not more often in regulatory sequences), and certain disease classes. We develop a method to calculate the likelihood that pleiotropic links between traits occurred more often than expected and demonstrate that this approach can identify etiological links that are already known (such as between fetal hemoglobin and malaria risk) and those that are not yet established (e.g., between plasma campesterol levels and gallstones risk; and between immunoglobulin A and juvenile idiopathic arthritis). Examples of pleiotropy will accumulate over time, but it is already clear that pleiotropy is a common property of genes and SNPs associated with disease traits, and this will have implications for identification of molecular targets for drug development, future genetic risk-profiling, and classification of diseases.}

As GWAS analyses are generally univariate in nature, multivariate phenotypic information is usually reduced to a single composite score. This practice often results in loss of statistical power to detect causal variants. Multivariate genotype-phenotype methods do exist but attain maximal power only in special circumstances. Here, we present a new multivariate method that we refer to as TATES (Trait-based Association Test that uses Extended Simes procedure), inspired by the GATES procedure proposed by Li et al (2011). For each component of a multivariate trait, TATES combines p-values obtained in standard univariate GWAS to acquire one trait-based p-value, while correcting for correlations between components. Extensive simulations, probing a wide variety of genotype-phenotype models, show that TATES's false positive rate is correct, and that TATES's statistical power to detect causal variants explaining 0.5\% of the variance can be 2.5-9 times higher than the power of univariate tests based on composite scores and 1.5-2 times higher than the power of the standard MANOVA. Unlike other multivariate methods, TATES detects both genetic variants that are common to multiple phenotypes and genetic variants that are specific to a single phenotype, i.e. TATES provides a more complete view of the genetic architecture of complex traits. As the actual causal genotype-phenotype model is usually unknown and probably phenotypically and genetically complex, TATES, available as an open source program, constitutes a powerful new multivariate strategy that allows researchers to identify novel causal variants, while the complexity of traits is no longer a limiting factor.}

Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies have pinpointed many loci associated with CVD risk factors in adults. It is unclear, however, if these loci predict trait levels at all ages, if they are associated with how a trait develops over time, or if they could be used to screen individuals who are pre-symptomatic to provide the opportunity for preventive measures before disease onset. We completed a genome-wide association study on participants in the longitudinal Bogalusa Heart Study (BHS) and have characterized the association between genetic factors and the development of CVD risk factors from childhood to adulthood. We report 7 genome-wide significant associations involving CVD risk factors, two of which have been previously reported. Top regions were tested for replication in the Young Finns Study (YF) and two associations strongly replicated: rs247616 in CETP with HDL levels (combined P = 9.7 x 10(-24)), and rs445925 at APOE with LDL levels (combined P = 8.7 x 10(-19)). We show that SNPs previously identified in adult cross-sectional studies tend to show age-independent effects in the BHS with effect sizes consistent with previous reports. Previously identified variants were associated with adult trait levels above and beyond those seen in childhood; however, variants with time-dependent effects were also promising predictors. This is the first GWA study to evaluate the role of common genetic variants in the development of CVD risk factors in children as they advance through adulthood and highlights the utility of using longitudinal studies to identify genetic predictors of adult traits in children.}

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Findings from family and twin studies suggest that genetic contributions to psychiatric disorders do not in all cases map to present diagnostic categories. We aimed to identify specific variants underlying genetic effects shared between the five disorders in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium: autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. METHODS: We analysed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for the five disorders in 33,332 cases and 27,888 controls of European ancestory. To characterise allelic effects on each disorder, we applied a multinomial logistic regression procedure with model selection to identify the best-fitting model of relations between genotype and phenotype. We examined cross-disorder effects of genome-wide significant loci previously identified for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and used polygenic risk-score analysis to examine such effects from a broader set of common variants. We undertook pathway analyses to establish the biological associations underlying genetic overlap for the five disorders. We used enrichment analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to assess whether SNPs with cross-disorder association were enriched for regulatory SNPs in post-mortem brain-tissue samples. FINDINGS: SNPs at four loci surpassed the cutoff for genome-wide significance (p<5×10(-8)) in the primary analysis: regions on chromosomes 3p21 and 10q24, and SNPs within two L-type voltage-gated calcium channel subunits, CACNA1C and CACNB2. Model selection analysis supported effects of these loci for several disorders. Loci previously associated with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia had variable diagnostic specificity. Polygenic risk scores showed cross-disorder associations, notably between adult-onset disorders. Pathway analysis supported a role for calcium channel signalling genes for all five disorders. Finally, SNPs with evidence of cross-disorder association were enriched for brain eQTL markers. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that specific SNPs are associated with a range of psychiatric disorders of childhood onset or adult onset. In particular, variation in calcium-channel activity genes seems to have pleiotropic effects on psychopathology. These results provide evidence relevant to the goal of moving beyond descriptive syndromes in psychiatry, and towards a nosology informed by disease cause.

  Abstract                 = {The association of genetic variants with outcomes is usually assessed under an additive model, for example by the trend test. However, misspecification of the genetic model will lead to a reduction in power. More robust tests for association might therefore be preferred. A useful approach is to consider the maximum of the three test statistics under additive, dominant and recessive models (MAX3). The p-value however has to be adjusted to maintain the type I error rate. Previous studies and software on robust association tests have focused on binary traits without covariates. In this study we developed an analytic approach to robust association tests using MAX3, allowing for quantitative or binary traits as well as covariates. The p-values from our theoretical calculations match very well with those from a bootstrap resampling procedure. The methodology is implemented in the R package RobustSNP which is able to handle both small-scale studies and GWAS.

This problem arises in many settings, including genetic association studies, where the explanatory variable is genotype at a genetic variant. We outline a framework for conducting this type of analysis, based on Bayesian model comparison and model averaging for multivariate regressions. This framework unifies several common approaches to this problem, and includes both standard univariate and standard multivariate association tests as special cases. The framework also unifies the problems of testing for associations and explaining associations - that is, identifying which outcome variables are associated with genotype. This provides an alternative to the usual, but conceptually unsatisfying, approach of resorting to univariate tests when explaining and interpreting significant multivariate findings. The method is computationally tractable genome-wide for modest numbers of phenotypes (e.g. 5-10), and can be applied to summary data, without access to raw genotype and phenotype data. We illustrate the methods on both simulated examples, and to a genome-wide association study of blood lipid traits where we identify 18 potential novel genetic associations that were not identified by univariate analyses of the same data.}

The investigated endophenotypes included personality traits and resilience factors. At 10-year follow-up, subjects were screened for depressive symptoms. All subjects were genotyped for rs1006737. The direction of the effect and mode of inheritance of rs1006737 differed between the sexes. In men, the A-allele was associated with higher emotional lability and lower resilience, that is, lower sense of coherence (P=0.021), lower perceived social support (P=0.018), lower dispositional optimism (P=0.032) and more depressive symptoms at follow-up (P=0.007). In women, the A-allele was associated with lower emotional lability and stronger resilience, that is, higher sense of coherence (P=0.00028), higher perceived social support (P=0.010), lower neuroticism (P=0.022) and fewer depressive symptoms at follow-up (P=0.035). After conservative Bonferroni correction for 32 tests, results only remained significant for sense of coherence in women (P=0.009). These results suggest that CACNA1C is involved in the genetic architecture of endophenotypes for affective disorders and schizophrenia, and that it shows a distinct sex-specific effect. Comprehensive phenotype characterization in case-control samples and the general population, as well as an adequate modeling of sex-specific genetic effects, may be warranted to elucidate the pathogenetic mechanisms conferred by robustly identified susceptibility genes.}

Global patterns of gene expression were compared in seedlings of these three genotypes by using a microarray that contains 13,999 cDNAs. Using an estimated 15\% false discovery rate as a cutoff, 1,367 ESTs (9.8\%) were identified as being significantly differentially expressed among genotypes. All possible modes of gene action were observed, including additivity, high- and low-parent dominance, underdominance, and overdominance. The largest proportion of the ESTs (78\%; 1,062 of 1,367) exhibited expression patterns that are not statistically distinguishable from additivity. Even so, 22\% of the differentially regulated ESTs exhibited nonadditive modes of gene expression. Classified on the basis of significant pairwise comparisons of genotype means, 181 of these 305 nonadditive ESTs exhibited high-parent dominance and 23 exhibited low-parent dominance. In addition, 44 ESTs exhibited underdominance or overdominance.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Several methods have been proposed to account for multiple comparisons in genetic association studies. However, investigators typically test each of the SNPs using multiple genetic models. Association testing using the Cochran-Armitage test for trend assuming an additive, dominant, or recessive genetic model, is commonly performed. Thus, each SNP is tested three times. Some investigators report the smallest p-value obtained from the three tests corresponding to the three genetic models, but such an approach inherently leads to inflated type 1 errors. Because of the small number of tests (three) and high correlation (functional dependence) among these tests, the procedures available for accounting for multiple tests are either too conservative or fail to meet the underlying assumptions (e.g., asymptotic multivariate normality or independence among the tests). RESULTS: We propose a method to calculate the exact p-value for each SNP using different genetic models. We performed simulations, which demonstrated the control of type 1 error and power gains using the proposed approach. We applied the proposed method to compute p-value for a polymorphism eNOS -786T>C which was shown to be associated with breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the proposed method should be used to maximize power and control type 1 errors when analyzing genetic data using additive, dominant, and recessive models.}

Although highlighted by the strong protective effect of the sickle-cell trait, the full impact of human genetics on resistance to the disease remains largely unexplored. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies are designed to unravel relevant genetic variants comprehensively; however, in malaria, as in other infectious diseases, these studies have been only partly successful. Here we identify two previously unknown loci associated with severe falciparum malaria in patients and controls from Ghana, West Africa. We applied the GWA approach to the diverse clinical syndromes of severe falciparum malaria, thereby targeting human genetic variants influencing any step in the complex pathogenesis of the disease. One of the loci was identified on chromosome 1q32 within the ATP2B4 gene, which encodes the main calcium pump of erythrocytes, the host cells of the pathogenic stage of malaria parasites. The second was indicated by an intergenic single nucleotide polymorphism on chromosome 16q22.2, possibly linked to a neighbouring gene encoding the tight-junction protein MARVELD3. The protein is expressed on endothelial cells and might therefore have a role in microvascular damage caused by endothelial adherence of parasitized erythrocytes. We also confirmed previous reports on protective effects of the sickle-cell trait and blood group O. Our findings underline the potential of the GWA approach to provide candidates for the development of control measures against infectious diseases in humans.}

Using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a quantitative measure of kidney function, as an example we constructed measurement error models of a quantitative trait with systematic and random error components. We then examined the effects on precision of the parameter estimate between genetic loci and eGFR resulting from varying the correlation and contribution of the error components. We also compared the empirical results from 3 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of kidney function in 9049 European Americans: a single measure, a 3-measure model of the same biomarker of kidney function, and a 6-measure model of different biomarkers of kidney function. Simulations showed that given the same amount of overall errors, inclusion of measures with less correlated systematic errors led to greater gain in precision. The empirical GWAS results confirmed that both the 3- and 6-measure models detected more eGFR-associated genomic loci with stronger statistical association than the single-measure model despite some heterogeneity among the measures. Multiple measures of a quantitative trait can increase the statistical power of a study without additional participant recruitment. However, careful attention must be paid to the correlation of systematic errors and inconsistent associations when different biomarkers or methods are used to measure the quantitative trait.}

However, an inflation of the test statistic can occur because of population substructure or cryptic relatedness, which could cause spurious associations. If information on a large number of genetic markers is available, adjusting the analysis results by using the method of genomic control (GC) is possible. GC was originally proposed to correct the Cochran-Armitage additive trend test. For non-additive models, correction has been shown to depend on allele frequencies. Therefore, usage of GC is limited to situations where allele frequencies of null markers and candidate markers are matched. In this work, we extended the capabilities of the GC method for non-additive models, which allows us to use null markers with arbitrary allele frequencies for GC. Analytical expressions for the inflation of a test statistic describing its dependency on allele frequency and several population parameters were obtained for recessive, dominant, and over-dominant models of inheritance. We proposed a method to estimate these required population parameters. Furthermore, we suggested a GC method based on approximation of the correction coefficient by a polynomial of allele frequency and described procedures to correct the genotypic (two degrees of freedom) test for cases when the model of inheritance is unknown. Statistical properties of the described methods were investigated using simulated and real data. We demonstrated that all considered methods were effective in controlling type 1 error in the presence of genetic substructure. The proposed GC methods can be applied to statistical tests for GWAS with various models of inheritance. All methods developed and tested in this work were implemented using R language as a part of the GenABEL package.}

Much research has been carried out on enhancing robustness of such model-based tests. An analysis framework that tests the equality of allele frequency while allowing for different deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) between cases and controls is proposed. The proposed method does not require specification of trait models nor HWE. It involves only 1 degree of freedom.

Same simulation studies as those reported in Galesloot et al. (2014) were conducted to assess its performance.

Successful utilization of this approach requires a large sample size to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with subtle effects. Meta-analysis is a cost-efficient means to achieve large sample size by combining data from multiple independent GWAS; however, results from studies performed on different populations can be variable due to various reasons, including varied linkage equilibrium structures as well as gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Nevertheless, one should expect effects of the SNP are more similar between similar populations than those between populations with quite different genetic and environmental backgrounds. Prior information on populations of GWAS is often not considered in current meta-analysis methods, rendering such analyses less optimal for the detecting association. This article describes a test that improves meta-analysis to incorporate variable heterogeneity among populations. The proposed method is remarkably simple in computation and hence can be performed in a rapid fashion in the setting of GWAS. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and higher power of the proposed method over conventional methods in the presence of heterogeneity. As a demonstration, we applied the test to real GWAS data to identify SNPs associated with circulating insulin-like growth factor I concentrations.}

Multivariate functional linear models are developed to connect genetic variant data to multiple quantitative traits adjusting for covariates for a unified analysis. Three types of approximate F- distribution tests based on Pillai–Bartlett trace, Hotelling–Lawley trace, and Wilks’s Lambda are introduced to test for association between multiple quantitative traits and multiple genetic variants in one genetic region. The approximate F-distribution tests provide much more significant results than those of F-tests of univariate analysis and optimal sequence kernel association test (SKAT-O). Extensive simulations were performed to evaluate the false positive rates and power performance of the proposed models and tests. We show that the approximate F-distribution tests control the type I error rates very well. Overall, simultaneous analysis of multiple traits can increase power performance compared to an individual test of each trait. The proposed methods were applied to analyze (1) four lipid traits in eight European cohorts, and (2) three biochemical traits in the Trinity Students Study. The approximate F-distribution tests provide much more significant results than those of F-tests of univariate analysis and SKAT-O for the three biochemical traits. The approximate F-distribution tests of the proposed functional linear models are more sensitive than those of the traditional multivariate linear models that in turn are more sensitive than SKAT-O in the univariate case. The analysis of the four lipid traits and the three biochemical traits detects more association than SKAT-O in the univariate case.}

  Abstract                 = {Although transmission disequilibrium tests (TDT) and the FBAT statistic are robust against population substructure, they have reduced statistical power, as compared with fully efficient tests that are not guarded against confounding because of population substructure. This has often limited the application of transmission disequilibrium tests/FBATs to candidate gene analysis, because, in a genome-wide association study, population substructure can be adjusted by approaches such as genomic control and EIGENSTRAT. Here, we provide new statistical methods for the analysis of quantitative and dichotomous phenotypes in extended families. Although the approach utilizes the polygenic model to maximize the efficiency, it still preserves the robustness to non-normality and misspecified covariance structures. In addition, the proposed method performs better than the existing methods for dichotomous phenotype, and the new transmission disequilibrium test for candidate gene analysis is more efficient than FBAT statistics.

In such situations, statistical methods using only one of these traits may be inadequate and lead to under-powered tests for detecting genetic associations. We propose in this article an estimation and testing procedure for evaluating the shared-association of a genetic marker on the joint distribution of multiple traits of a common disease. Specifically, we assume that the disease mechanism involves both quantitative and qualitative traits, and our samples could be stratified based on the qualitative trait. Through a joint likelihood function, we derive a class of estimators and test statistics for evaluating the shared genetic association on both the quantitative and qualitative traits. Our simulation study shows that the joint likelihood test procedure is potentially more powerful than association tests based on separate traits. Application of our proposed procedure is demonstrated through the rheumatoid arthritis data provided by the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 (GAW16).}

It is known that population stratification (PS) often affects population-based association studies. However, how it would affect the inverted regression for pleiotropic association, especially with the mixed types of traits (binary and quantitative), is not examined and the performance of existing methods to correct for PS using the inverted regression analysis is unknown. In this paper, we focus on the methods based on genomic control and principal component analysis, and investigate type I error of pleiotropic association using the inverted regression model in the presence of PS with allele frequencies and the distributions (or disease prevalences) of multiple traits varying across the subpopulations. We focus on common alleles but simulation results for a rare variant are also reported. An application to the HapMap data is used for illustration.}

  Abstract                 = {Multiple comparisons or multiple testing has been viewed as a thorny issue in genetic association studies aiming to detect disease-associated genetic variants from a large number of genotyped variants. We alleviate the problem of multiple comparisons by proposing a hierarchical modeling approach that is fundamentally different from the existing methods. The proposed hierarchical models simultaneously fit as many variables as possible and shrink unimportant effects towards zero. Thus, the hierarchical models yield more efficient estimates of parameters than the traditional methods that analyze genetic variants separately, and also coherently address the multiple comparisons problem due to largely reducing the effective number of genetic effects and the number of statistically "significant" effects. We develop a method for computing the effective number of genetic effects in hierarchical generalized linear models, and propose a new adjustment for multiple comparisons, the hierarchical Bonferroni correction, based on the effective number of genetic effects. Our approach not only increases the power to detect disease-associated variants but also controls the Type I error. We illustrate and evaluate our method with real and simulated data sets from genetic association studies. The method has been implemented in our freely available R package BhGLM (http://www.ssg.uab.edu/bhglm/).}

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The Cochran-Armitage trend test (CATT) is powerful in detecting association between a susceptible marker and a disease. This test, however, may suffer from a substantial loss of power when the underlying genetic model is unknown and incorrectly specified. Thus, it is useful to derive tests obtaining the plausible power against all common genetic models. For this purpose, the genetic model selection (GMS) and genetic model exclusion (GME) methods were proposed recently. Simulation results showed that GMS and GME can obtain the plausible power against three common genetic models while the overall type I error is well controlled. RESULTS: Although GMS and GME are powerful statistically, they could be seriously affected by known confounding factors such as gender, age and race. Therefore, in this paper, via comparing the difference of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium coefficients between the cases and the controls within each sub-population, we propose the stratified genetic model selection (SGMS) and exclusion (SGME) methods which could eliminate the effect of confounding factors by adopting a matching framework. Our goal in this paper is to investigate the robustness of the proposed statistics and compare them with other commonly used efficiency robust tests such as MAX3 and $\chi$2 with 2 degrees of freedom (df) test in matched case-control association designs through simulation studies. CONCLUSION: Simulation results showed that if the mean genetic effect of the heterozygous genotype is between those of the two homozygous genotypes, then the proposed tests and MAX3 are preferred. Otherwise, $\chi$2 with 2 df test may be used. To illustrate the robust procedures, the proposed tests are applied to a real matched pair case-control etiologic study of sarcoidosis.}

To apply the trend test, a set of ordered scores is assigned a priori based on the underlying genetic model. Pearson's test is model-free and robust, but is less powerful for common genetic models. MAX is another robust test statistic, which takes the maximum of the trend tests over a family of scientifically plausible genetic models. We show that the three test statistics are all trend tests but with different types of scores; whether the scores are prespecified or data-driven, or whether the scores are ordered (restricted) or not ordered (unrestricted). We then provide insights into power performance of the three tests when the underlying genetic model is unknown and discuss which test to use for the analyses of case-control genetic association studies.}

A unified approach is presented for deriving the bias and variance distortion under the three scenarios for any CATT in a general family. Using these analytical formulas, we evaluate the excess type I errors of the CATTs numerically in the presence of population substructure.

The h-index is based on the philosophy of using orthogonal contrasts to infer the mode of inheritance quantitatively.

The simulations showed that none of the two approaches generally outperforms the other, nor each of them provides a panacea to estimate efficiently the mode of inheritance in all parameter space. However, the simultaneous application of both approaches can provide insights in determining the underlying mode of inheritance.}
